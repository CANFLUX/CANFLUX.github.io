* It would be pretty straightforward to go ahead and host the downloaded AMERIFLUX data here until something more comprehensive can be developed

* The RShiny app could be embedded in this webpage, but if it becomes too large it could create a clunky user experience.
    * A better approach may be to have a webmap with the sites, perhaps with a popup that gives a standardized summary of data, and a link to download the full datasets?

* Procedures for collecting and hosting data are still being developed.
