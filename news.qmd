A big thanks to the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/mcgillmssi/" target="_blank">McGill Sustainability Systems Initiative (MSSI)<a> for supporting the inaugural CanFlux Workshop through their Catalyst Grant. This workshop brought together researchers, government scientists, private sector stakeholders, Indigenous representatives, and policy makers to co-develop CanFlux â€“ a revitalized national GHG flux observation network. Thanks to everyone who attended! And thanks to my amazing co-conveners Scott J. Davidson, Oliver Sonnentag, Michelle Garneau, Rosie Howard, Martina Schlaipfer, and Evan Henry.
